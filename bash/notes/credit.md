All credit for the notes that I am doing here go to William E. Shotts, the creator and maintainer of The Linux Command Line. I have handwritten all the notes myself but have taken some of the examples straight from the free 7th edition of this book. 

Widely considered to be the gold standard of becoming deeply familiar with the Linux command line. Very much worth checking out his work and supporting him [here](https://linuxcommand.org/).
